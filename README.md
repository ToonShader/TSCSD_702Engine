# TSCSD_702Engine
Copyright 2017 Cameron Dillon

Note: Please see https://github.com/ToonShader/SpectralEngine for the rendering engine under active development. Originally the plan for this repository was to refactor the rendering portion (in DirectX 11) of a 3D chess game I built into a much more extensible and easy to use library. While in the planning stages I decided to make the jump to DirectX 12 and, after some initial work and investigation, decided it would be more time efficient to build a new engine in DirectX 12 rather than perform two refactors (one for DirectX 12 and one for the engine architecture).

Repository for the 702Engine and sample game.
